This folder contains the following data:

  * `VOC_AUG_2012` : PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset with augmented segmentation annotations.
  * `MSCOCO` : Subset of MS-COCO images containing categories exclusive to PASCAL VOC dataset.
  * `imagesets` : list of images and their annotations to train our model.

Note that we re-essigned ids of 60 MS-COCO categories to 21-80 to avoid conflict with PASCAL VOC category ids (1-20).
